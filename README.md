Hunt Royale Discord Hunt Helper

A Discord bot that was used by the official Hunt Royale Discord server.
Now it's open source and only to demonstrate what has been done previously.

The purpose of this project was for players to be able to find games, which was then posted across multiple discord servers. The post would include the players in-game ID and the game mode they were looking to play.

I no longer intend to use the bot as is and it is no longer online.
It's simply a project to showcase my Go skills.
It was not written using AI, it was written by me from scratch.

The full code history is present, with the inclusion of bot tokens and database credentials which have all been rotated and are no longer in use.
